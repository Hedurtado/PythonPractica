# Given a checkParity(n) function, write code to determine if a given number n is even or odd.
# Think of this as a function that returns 0 if the number is even, and 1 if it is odd. You have
# been given some starter code where the function and return statement have already been written,
# so donâ€™t worry about any Python-specific details about functions; just implement the function logic!

def checkParity(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1


n = int(input("Give me a number:"))
print(checkParity(n))
